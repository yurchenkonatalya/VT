    <p class="text_about_us">Meet my family. There are five of us – my parents, my elder brother, my baby sister and me. First, meet my mum and dad, Jane and Michael. My mum enjoys reading and my dad enjoys playing chess with my brother Ken. My mum is slim and rather tall. She has long red hair and big brown eyes. She has a very pleasant smile and a soft voice. My mother is very kind and understanding. We are real friends. She is a housewife. As she has three children, she is always busy around the house. She takes care of my baby sister Meg, who is only three months old </p>

    <h1>Company</h1>
    <p>Is an acronym formed from the Latin phrase QUOD ERAT DEMONSTRANDUM („which was to be proven“), which was traditionally placed in its abbreviated form at the end of a mathematical proof. The acronym notified readers of a proof that they had achieved what they wanted – that they had successfully completed an unfinished shape. From a psychological point of view, the QED abbreviation marks the moment of confirmation that we have achieved our goal. Thanks to this confirmation, the efforts we invested in our previous steps can pay dividends and be put to good use. This originally mathematical meaning also represents the philosophy of QED Group. Our main objective is that our services have demonstrable benefits for our clients that will take them further on their journey toward desired goals.</p>
